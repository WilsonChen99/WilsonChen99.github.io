<p>
    My journey as an animal lover began with the joy of observing and learning about different species. 
    Whether it's the elegant grace of a blue whale or the playful antics of a squirrel, I find myself captivated by the intricacies 
    of the animal world. This fascination naturally led me to adopt a lifestyle centered around compassion and respect for all 
    living beings.<br/><br/>
    I became a proud owner of my beloved cat, Kimchi, in 2020, and this has taught me invaluable lessons about responsibility, empathy, 
    and unconditional love. Caring for her goes far beyond providing food and shelter; it involves forming a deep 
    bond based on trust and understanding. The moments of purring contentment in my lap or the gentle headbutts of affection remind 
    me daily of the immense joy that comes from being in the presence of such incredible creatures.

<p>
Nature has always been my sanctuary, and through hiking, I find a profound connection with it. Whether I'm trekking along winding trails, 
conquering rugged mountains, or crossing babbling streams, each step I take brings a sense of liberation and a deeper appreciation for the 
natural world.<br/><br/>
Moreover, my love for hiking extends beyond personal enjoyment; it also profoundly impacts my educational and professional 
life. Over time, I've come to realize that true excellence isn't solely about refining technical skills. Taking occasional 
getaways in nature enables me to maintain a healthy energy level and a refreshed mind, allowing me to tackle any challenges 
that arise with renewed vigor.

export const artist =

    <p>
        Ever since I can remember, I have been captivated by the world of colors, shapes, and textures. From the first time I held a crayon in my hand 
        as a child, I knew that art would forever be an integral part of who I am.<br/><br/>
        Countless hours dedicated to sketching and painting have revealed to me a profound truth: everything in life has its own rhythm, and the essence 
        of art lies in capturing those delicate details and presenting them in the captivating forms of images, sounds and architecture.<br/><br/>
        Engaging in both art and science, two seemingly opposite disciplines, has profoundly enriched my life, molding me into a more holistic and 
        well-rounded individual.<br/><br/>
